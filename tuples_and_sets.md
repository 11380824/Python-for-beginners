* Tuples are different from lists they use parenthesis
* They are immmutable and they can't be change or you can't delete a value from it.

```Python
x = (1,2,3,4,5)
#Its a tuple
```

* They are safer less bugs and problems
* You can also use tuples as the keys in dictionary

* .index()

# Sets in Python
