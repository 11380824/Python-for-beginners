# Modules
Python modules allows us to reuse our own code or sometimes use somebody else's code.
We can write our own modules or we can use modules written by someone else like `requests`,`datetime` and `etc`.

**Note**: It's just a `python` file.

## Built-in Modules
There built-in python modules that come by default.
List can be found here [LIST OF MODULES](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)

- We can import modules by using `import` keyword
- We can also give modules an `alias` when we have long module names like `import random as r`.
- We can also import few functions from the modules `from random import randint`.
- If you want to import everything from random we do something like this `from random import *`

## Custom Modules
Custom module is just file with python code.
