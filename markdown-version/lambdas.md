# Lambdas Functions in Python
Lambdas are one line functions. They are also known as anonymous functions in some other languages. You might want to use lambdas when you donâ€™t want to use a function twice in a program. They are just like normal functions and even behave like them.

```python3
def square(x):
    return x * x
# But Lamdas are totally different

square = lambda x:x*x
print(square(2))
# You can also store lamda inside of a variable
# In this case we are passing x as an parameter. Basically they are short and # anonymous functions
# Lambdas don't have a name'
```

#### Map() function in Lambdas
* It's a standard function that accepts at least two arguements a function and an iterable
* Iterable can be lists tuples or dictionary
* Runs lambda for each value and then returns
```python3
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
x = map(lambda x:x*x,nums)
print(list(x))
# This shows how map() function works. We are passing lamda function that will square each number in the list nums
```
