### Variable in Python 
In this section we are going to learn how to represent variables in python language
It helps you store the data better so therefore we use the variable.
* Variables can be reassigned at any time 
* We can also assign variables together
* We can also assign variables to each other

```Python
x = 100
y = 10
all, us , about = 10, 11 ,12
#In this case we have assigned variables at once
print(x+y) #This will print 110
print(us) # TO see if it is going to print the us variable that we declared
```
#### Variable Naming Conventions
* There are some naming variable conventions used in python language
* You cannot start a variable with a number 
* Lowercase and Uppercase does matter when naming the variables
* Naming conventions are really import
* Variables should be snake_case (This makes your code looks better its just a convetion)
* Most variables are lowercase
* Upper camelcase is usually used for the classes
* Variables that start with dunder: double underscores **Dont Touch Them**
* Variables should Contain valid data types

```Python
2cats = 10 #This is wrong
_cats = 10 #This is totally fine 
hey@hey = 10 # This is not good

cats != CATS
# In this case python language reads them differently

__dont_touch__ #Dunder Variable
```
