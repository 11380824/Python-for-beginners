### Dictionaries in Python
* Dictionaries vs List. Lists have its own limitations like it can contain one data type and data can't be modeled correctly if we are using lists
* Dictionary is a data structure that contains key value pairs
* Keys are used to describe the data
* Values are used to represent the data

#### This is how a dictionary looks like
**Note: key-value pairs are separated by the commas **
```Python
info = {
    'name':'John',
    'city':'New York',
    'own_a_car':True,
}
```
