## Python For  Beginners
The goal for creating this was to help people who are learning Python. I was already learning Python But then this idea sparked in my mind that why not I should document the process of learning Python and help beginners like me so they don't struggle with topics that I did.
That was the main goal in my mind while creating this repository.

## Who this is for 

* This is mainly aimed toward beginners but I will be adding more topics to this and even exercises. 
* Anyone can use this repository to study/learn python.

## Your Help
* In order to make this better I need your help to add more stuff to it and It can be anything related to python.


#### Note
* If you liked it please star this repo it will help me motivate to work on this more.
