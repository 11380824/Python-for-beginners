#### Python Data Types

* Bool: True or False values
* int : Its an integer like 5,3,4
* str : Its a sequence of characters for example "Your name" this is a string
* list: Its a ordered sequence of different data types for example ['1','apple','10.5']
* dict : Its a collection of key value pairs {'name':'john'}
```Python 
x = true # Boolean
y = "Hello World" # This is a string
numbers = [1,2,3,'four'] # this is a list
v = {
    'name':'john'
    'address':'xyz street'
}# Its a dictionary in python

```

##### Important Note
* Python is dynamically typed language it means that variable can be changed readily but its different in languages like JAVA, C++ C or etc where we have to specify the variable type thats why they are called statically typed languages
**None Key Word in Python is just like Null**
**We can use type() Function to see the data type**
