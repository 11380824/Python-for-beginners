#### Booleans and Conditionals
```Python3
# A psuedo code example
if some condition is true:
    do this
elif Some other condition is true:
    Do this
else:
    do something else

```

```Python3
# A real example of Conditonals
if x == 5:
    print('Five')
elif x == 6:
    print('Six')
else:
    print('Nothing is valid')
```

#### Falsiness and Truthiness
* This really matter
* Empty strings, None , 0 has a false value
* Everything else has true value 

**Indentation really matters in Python Language and (:) These colons help us indent the blocks**
**You can have multiple (elifs)**
